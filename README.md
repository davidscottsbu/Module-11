The purpose of this project was to collect, organize, store, analzye and visualize data.
Using BeautifulSoup I scraped the data in the html table then stored the data

In the second part of this project I scapred an html table into a pandas dataframe using BeautifulSoup.  I then analyzed the data to answer questions regarding the data while crreated visualizations to support each answer.  The dataframe was then exported into a csv file.
